## Plumaa

**Plumaa is a [Safe Wallet](https://app.safe.global/) module that enables SHA PKCS1.5 signatures to be used as signer mechanism for EVM transactions**.

## Getting started

Install dependencies with

```bash
forge install
```

To run tests, you'll need to setup the /keys directory. Follow its [README](./keys/README.md) for more information.

Once keys are set, run tests with:

```bash
forge clean && forge test
```
